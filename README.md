# Morse-Code-Decoder

Source Code for MorseCodeDecode final project from AP Computer Science A class from 2019. 

### Program Function
This program has two different GUIs that flashes Morse Code and Decodes Morse Code. The Flasher interface takes text input and flashes the morse code translation using the screen. The Decoder interface connects to a light sensor Phidget and displays the voltage reading onto a graph relative to the threshold line. The flashes detected by the sensor is translated back into letters. This works for syntax expressible in Morse Code only (ie. only English words). The two interfaces are meant to work together since the frequency to flash and detect are manually set to work together.
